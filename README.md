A Simulator is present that can run as a separate program and that will send simulated data to Tracking Server. The Simulator will read an input file to simulate a real roadrace, but potentially much faster than the actual event would take in real life. Clients (spectators, support personnel, and officials) will subscribe with the server to receive tracking information about specific athletes and will display information about athletes and their status.
